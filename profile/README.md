## 🎯 Proven Data Integration Patterns

8kit implements four core patterns that solve the most common integration challenges:

### 1. **Do-once Pattern** - Idempotency
Prevent duplicate processing with reliable idempotency controls.

### 2. **Data Mapping Pattern** - ID Resolution
Seamlessly map identifiers across different systems with enterprise-grade reliability.

### 3. **Exclusivity Pattern** - Concurrency Control
Prevent parallel updates and ensure data consistency with distributed locks.

### 4. **Temporal Pattern** - Time-based Coordination
Coordinate time-sensitive operations and manage temporal dependencies.
